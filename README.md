# Stardew Save File Structures
Architecture/Structure of different Stardew Valley Save Files

I ran various versions of Stardew Valley save files through an XML parser to generate the structures. Bear in mind that in some instances nodes are repeated multiple times, e.g. the farmhand node on multiplayer saves.

I've needed this info for some time. Figured I'd put it up for others in case they need it.

## Versions

* **multiplayer_architecture.txt**: A fresh Multiplayer save with any number of farmhands. Game v1.5.6
* **moddedsp_archetecture.txt**: A heavily modded and perfected single-player save using just shy of 200 mods including SVE, Ridgeside and Raffadax. Game v1.5.6
* **remixedsp_architecture.txt**: Remixed singleplayer vanilla. Game v1.5.6
